# Overview
Array is the most basic structure of computer science. Most operations as well as other data structures are built and performed on an array. In this project, we make an application GUI to explain three sorting algorithms on an array: [bubble sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/), [heap sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-sort/), [shell sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shellsort/)

**Specifications**:

- GUI:  Freely design own GUI. However, since the basic aim of the project is to develop an application based on OOP, focusing on the interface is not required.
    
    - [Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Counting, Radix)](https://visualgo.net/en/sorting)
    
    - [Bubble Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmhjrI-aW5o)
    
    - [Heap Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtQL_ll5KhQ)
    
    - [Shell Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHcPqUe2GZM)
    
- Design:
    - On the main menu: title of the application, 3 types of sort algorithms for the user to choose, help menu, quit
        - User must select a sort type to start the demonstration.
        - Help menu shows the basic usage and aim of the program.
        - Quit option exits the program - ask for confirmation.
    - In the demonstration:
        - A button for creating the array: The user can choose to randomly create an array or input an array for the program.
        - A button for starting the algorithm with the created array - show clearly each step of the sorting.
        - A back button for the user to return to the main menu at any time.
